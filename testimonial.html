                           "My journey as an intern in BBU Law Function was truly an illuminating experience.
                            Starting from some truly awe-inspiring mentors to amazing work environment in and around the office, 
                            I could not have asked for a better place to kickstart my career. Wherever I go in my professional career.
                           Chevron Bangladesh will always have a special place in my heart.</p>

        My internship at Chevron Bangladesh introduced me to the corporate world's best practices. I learned the importance of following guidelines,
         focusing on operational excellence, and prioritizing safety - skiis crucial in my current role in the aviation sector, where safety protocols
          are equally vital, as a lapse can be catastrophic. Moreover, the mentorship and guidance ! received at Chevron were invaluable. They played
           a pivotal role in shaping who I am today as a professional. In hindsight, my time at Chevron was more than an internship, it was a transformative
            journey that prepared me for the next stage of my career.
        I'm sincerely grateful for the experience and lessons learned during my tenure there as a Legal intern."</p>

        I was a part of the monumental document management project of Chevron Bangladesh Business Unit that comprised
         of digitalization of 25 years of legal and executive but mostly executive correspondence and reports. As it
          was my first professional experience, I learned a lot from this internship. Learning how to keep records
           immaculately and keeping track of that in OneNote and MS Excel were part of my learning experience that
            helped me the most. Also attending town hall meetings and knowing at least the basics of how Chevron operates was fascinating. 
            All these skills helped me to understand corporate culture, time management and working under pressure and deadlines,
             I am grateful for that experience."</p>

         with various IT solutions - from developing the Adairo App which improved the efficiency and productivity
          of the legal team, to designing and developing this Website. I also had the honor to present my project 
          to the Chevron leaders of Bangladesh, being the first intern in the history of Chevron to participate 
          in a BLT Meeting. As such, I had grown a keen interest in learning about the business and legal aspects,
           and how to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical domains. Chevron Bangladesh has been a
            valuable part of my professional journey, and I will always cherish the memories and experiences I gained here."</p>

        "Coming in as intern with some previous experience, working with the Chevron Law Function has been a breath of fresh air.
         Not only is the work culture very professional - the people here are truly wonderful to work and learn under. 
         From my direct supervisor to the director of the department, each person contributed towards creating an environment 
         where I felt genuinely motivated towards contributing towards the team's goals. And not only did I receive recognition
          when I made useful contributions, they also gave me actionable feedback when appropriate - which has truly helped me
           to grow both as a young professional, and as a person. Finding a workplace where one can feel emotionally invested 
           in their work is something I'll never take for granted, and I can only hope that my next workplace can even come close
            to my experience here as an intern."</p>
